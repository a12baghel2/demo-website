This change has both positive as well as negative influence to the society. Today, men like to wear Jeans, T-shirts, Shirts, Trousers instead of Kurta Pajama, Dhoti, etc. Similarly, women prefer to wear Tops, Tunics, Jeans, etc. in place of saree, lehenga, and other traditional dresses.

            <br><b>Celebration:</b> India is a land of diversity. Indians always try to adapt to new environment and make themselves equal to the rest of the world. Now-a-days people just want a reason to celebrate. They enjoy to roam and hangout with their friends and families. People like to go for vacation unlike the old times where people used to sit in their house. That’s why, in India also, people celebrate the Valentine’s Day, Christmas Day, Women’s Day, Children’s Day and many more. There is a reason behind the celebration of any occasion and people enjoy the day totally.

            That was just a small taste of Indian culture. There is more to discover around every corner. India’s culture is amazingly rich, diverse, and steeped in history. It is one of the reasons why the country receives a high number of visitors every year.
