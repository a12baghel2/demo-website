        <h1>What is Cultural <span>Diversity?<span></h1>
        <h3>Cultural diversity is the quality of diverse or different cultures, as opposed to monoculture, the global
          monoculture, or a homogenization of cultures, akin to cultural decay. The phrase cultural diversity can also
          refer to having different cultures respect each other's differences. The phrase "cultural diversity" is also
          sometimes used to mean the variety of human societies or cultures in a specific region, or in the world as a whole.
           Globalization is often said to have a negative effect on the world's cultural diversity.</h3>
        <h2>Over<span>view</span></h2>
        <p>Diversity refers to the attributes that people use to confirm themselves with respect to others, “that person is
        different from me.” These attributes include demographic factors (such as race, gender, and age) as well as values and cultural norms.
        The many separate societies that emerged around the globe differs markedly from each other, and many of these differences persist to this day.
        The more obvious cultural differences that exist between people are language, dress and traditions, there are also significant variations
        in the way societies organize themselves, such as in their shared
        conception of morality, religious belief, and in the ways they interact with their environment. Cultural diversity can
       be seen as analogous to biodiversity.</p>
