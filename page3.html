          <h1>Cultural Diversity at <span>Workplace</span></h1>
          <p>Cultural diversity in the workplace is a result of practices, values, traditions, or beliefs of employees based on race,
            age, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
            <br>
            Economic globalization is one of the driving forces of cultural diversity in the workplace. The modern workforce is made up
             of people of different genders, ages, ethnicity, religions, and nationalities. Employers have realized that workforce diversity
             provides both material and intangible benefits. In order for employers to reap the benefits of cultural diversity in the workplace
             , they must communicate their commitment to addressing the challenges of a diverse workforce. Employers must be seen to be celebra
             ting their employees’ diversity to avoid workplace issues, like awkwardness and hostility.

           <h2>Types of <span>Diversity</span></h2>
           <p>

             Although every human being can be described as being diverse because they have unique points of view, diversity in the workforce refers to specific groups who have typically experienced discrimination. Company diversity and inclusion programs are introduced to overcome barriers to different groups of people working together in a productive way.



             <br>The following are some of the different types of diversity in the workplace:

             <br><b>Education</b> – There can be tension between employees who have undertaken the academic route to employment and those whose experience is of a vocational nature. This cultural difference could result in a conflict where it’s disputed whether practical or theoretical experience will help the company achieve maximum growth.
             <br><b>Ethnicity</b> – This type of cultural diversity at work can be apparent when there are language barriers or a difference in how business is carried out. Some companies have specialist ethnic groups like the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for under-represented communities.
             <br><b>Generations</b> – Generation X, millennials, and traditionalists are some of the different generations that make up a diverse workforce. This type of diversity is characterized by differences in how work is viewed. For example, millennials are known for seeking flexibility in their work and doing jobs that align with their personal values.
             <br><b>Gender</b> – According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 36% of women had a bachelor’s degree by the age of 31 in comparison to 28% of men. However, research by the Pew Research Centre found that, in 2017, women earned 82% of what men earned. As well as pay disparities, women also face other workplace issues such as harassment.
             <br><b>Religion</b> – Various religious beliefs may be over in the workplace, for example, different dress, dietary requirements, and requesting particular days off. However, religion may be more understated, for instance, how the person interacts with their team members.
             <br><b>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT)</b> – The LGBT community is made up of distinct groups who have unique needs and experiences. Companies need to bear this in mind when creating LGBT strategies in order to address this group’s needs.
             <br><b>Workers with disabilities</b> – This group is very diverse in relation to the challenges they face and their needs. The range of disabilities can include vision, learning, and mental health. As a result, companies need to ensure that their diversity and inclusion programs recognize and make provision for the wide spectrum of disabilities.
             <br><b>Military veterans</b> – The Department of Labor specifies targets for contractors and federal agencies in terms of employing military veterans. Although veterans generally have many transferable skills, like teamwork and strong discipline, they may need a company’s assistance in transitioning from a military environment to a workplace.
